//! An implementation of a local Wallet used by clients and nodes (the latter use them for their rewards).
//! There is one which is deposit only, and one which can also send tokens.
//!
//! Later, a network Wallet store can be implemented thusly:
//! 1. Chunk each Dbc.
//! 2. For a semi-public Wallet:
//!     a. Store a register with address of your `PublicAddress`.
//!    Then push these ops:
//!     b. self.address.encrypt(Deposit(ChunkAddress))
//!     c. self.address.encrypt(Spend(ChunkAddress))
//!    And when the register has used 1023 entries:
//!     d. self.address.encrypt(Extend(RegisterAddress))
//!     ... which would occupy the last entry, and thus link to a new register.
//! 3. For a private Wallet:
//!     a. Store a register with address of self.address.encrypt(self.address).
//!     ... then follow from b. in 2.
//! 4. Then, when a wallet is to be loaded from the network:
//!     a. Get the `PublicAddress` from your secret.
//!     b. Fetch the register with address of either the plaintext of or the encrypted `PublicAddress`.
//!     c. Decrypt all entries and apply the ops to your Wallet, to get the current state of it.
//!     d. If there is another register linked at the end of this one, follow that link and repeat steps b., c. and d.
//!
//! We will already now pave for that, by mimicing that flow for the local storage of a Wallet.
//! First though, a simpler local storage will be used. But after that a local register store can be implemented.
