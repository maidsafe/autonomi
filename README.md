### For Users

- [CLI](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_cli/README.md) The Command Line Interface, allowing users to interact with the network from their terminal.
- [Node](https://github.com/maidsafe//safe_network/blob/main/sn_node/README.md) The backbone of the safe network. Nodes can be run on commodity hardware and provide storage space and validation of transactions to the network.

### For Developers

- [Client](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_client/README.md) The client APIs allowing use of the SafeNetwork to users and developers.
- [Registers](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_registers/README.md) The CRDT registers structures available on the network.
- [Testnet](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_testnet/README.md) The testnet crate, used to set up a local network for development and testing.
- [Faucet](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_faucet/README.md) The local faucet server, used to claim genesis and request tokens from the network.
- [Node RPC](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_node_rpc_client/README.md) The RPC server used by the nodes to expose API calls to the outside world.

#### Transport Protocols and Architectures

The Safe Network uses `quic` as the default transport protocol.

The `websockets` feature is available for the `sn_networking` crate, and above, and will allow for tcp over websockets.

If building for `wasm32` then `websockets` are enabled by default as this is the only method avilable to communicate with a network as things stand. (And that network must have `websockets` enabled.)

##### Building for wasm32

- Install [wasm-pack](https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/installer/)
- `cd sn_client && wasm-pack build`

You can then pull this package into a web app eg, to use it.

eg `await safe.get_data("/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/59324/ws/p2p/12D3KooWG6kyBwLVHj5hYK2SqGkP4GqrCz5gfwsvPBYic4c4TeUz","9d7e115061066126482a229822e6d68737bd67d826c269762c0f64ce87af6b4c")`

#### Browser usage

Browser usage is highly experimental, but the wasm32 target for `sn_client` _should_ work here. YMMV until stabilised.

### For the Technical

- [Logging](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_logging/README.md) The generalised logging crate used by the safe network (backed by the tracing crate).
- [Metrics](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/metrics/README.md) The metrics crate used by the safe network.
- [Networking](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_networking/README.md) The networking layer, built atop libp2p which allows nodes and clients to communicate.
- [Protocol](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_protocol/README.md) The protocol used by the safe network.
- [Transfers](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_transfers/README.md) The transfers crate, used to send and receive tokens on the network.
- [Peers Acquisition](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_peers_acquisition/README.md) The peers peers acqisition crate, or: how the network layer discovers bootstrap peers.
- [Build Info](https://github.com/maidsafe/safe_network/blob/main/sn_build_info/README.md) Small helper used to get the build/commit versioning info for debug purposes.

## Run your MaidSafe Local Test Network in 4 easy Steps
Before you start, make sure to have **[Rust installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)** and the latest version with `rustup update`
<br>
1. Create your Local Test Network : <br>
```bash
cargo run --bin testnet --features="local-discovery" -- --build-node --build-faucet --interval 100 --clean
```
2. Build a Tokenized Wallet : <br>
```bash
cargo run --release --bin safe --features=local-discovery -- wallet get-faucet 127.0.0.1:8000
```
3. Upload your chosen Directory to the Local Test Network : <br>
```bash
cargo run --release --bin safe --features=local-discovery -- files upload <directory-path-goes-here>
```
4. Download the Directory Contents from the Local Test Network : <br>
```bash
cargo run --release --bin safe --features=local-discovery -- files download
```
## Shut down Your Test Network
On Windows (PowerShell)
```bash
Get-Process safenode | Stop-Process; Get-Process faucet | Stop-Process
```
For MacOS<br>
```bash
killall safenode || true && RUST_LOG=safenode,safe cargo run --bin testnet -- --build-node --build-faucet --interval 100  && export SAFE_PEERS=$(rg "listening on \".+\"" ~/.local/share/safe -u | rg '/ip4.*$' -m1 -o | rg '"' -r '')
```

## Token transfers

- Get your wallet address
  `cargo run --release --bin safe -- wallet address`

- Send tokens to an address, this will output a Transfer hex string that you must send to the recipient out-of-band
  `cargo run --release --bin safe -- wallet send [amount] [address]`

- Receive tokens from a Transfer hex string
  `cargo run --release --bin safe -- wallet receive [transfer]`

## Auditing

- Verify a Spend on the Network (optionally recursively all the way back to genesis)
  `cargo run --release --bin safe -- wallet verify [--genesis] [spend address]`

- Audit all the Spends on the Network from Genesis
  `cargo run --release --bin safe -- wallet audit`

## Using example app which exercises the Register APIs

You can run the `registers` example client app from multiple consoles simultaneously,
to write to the same Register on the network, identified by its nickname and
using different usernames from each instance launched, e.g.:

From first console:
```
cargo run --release --example registers -- --user alice --reg-nickname myregister
```

From a second console:
```
cargo run --release --example registers -- --user bob --reg-nickname myregister
```

## Using the example RPC client app to query info and send cmds to a running safenode

- Query basic node info
```
$ cargo run --release --bin=safenode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:12001 info
Node info:
===================
RPC endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:12001
Peer Id: 12D3KooWB5CXPPtbVzZ7K9dv8xLj4JAPVEQu7ehibs2bWrqwiowy
Logs dir: /home/bochaco/.safe/node/local-test-network/safenode-1
PID: 490955
Binary version: 0.1.0
Time since last restart: 650s
```

- Query info about node's connections to the network:
```
$ cargo run --release --bin=safenode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:12001 netinfo
Node's connections to the Network:

Connected peers:

- Restarting/Updating/Stopping a node
```
$ cargo run --release --bin=safenode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:12001 restart 5000
Node successfully received the request to restart in 5s

$ cargo run --release --bin=safenode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:12001 stop 6000
Node successfully received the request to stop in 6s

$ cargo run --release --bin=safenode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:12001 update 7000
Node successfully received the request to try to update in 7s
```

- Listening to network royalties payments events
```
$ cargo run --release --bin=safenode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:12001 transfers
Listening to transfers notifications... (press Ctrl+C to exit)

New transfer notification received for PublicKey(0c54..5952), containing 1 cash note/s.
CashNote received with UniquePubkey(PublicKey(19ee..1580)), value: 0.000000001

New transfer notification received for PublicKey(0c54..5952), containing 1 cash note/s.
CashNote received with UniquePubkey(PublicKey(19ee..1580)), value: 0.000000001

```

A path to local disk where to store royalties payments cash notes received can be provided as well, e.g.:
```
$ cargo run --release --bin=safenode_rpc_client -- 127.0.0.1:12001 transfers ./royalties-cash-notes
Listening to transfers notifications... (press Ctrl+C to exit)
Writing cash notes to: ./royalties-cash-notes

```
Each CashNote is written to a separate file in respective recipient public address dir in the created cash_notes dir. Each file is named after the CashNote id.

# Metrics Dashboard

Use the `open-metrics` feature flag on the node / client to start an [OpenMetrics](https://github.com/OpenObservability/OpenMetrics/) exporter. The metrics are served via a webserver started at a random port. Check the log file / stdout to find the webserver URL, `Metrics server on http://127.0.0.1:xxxx/metrics`

The metrics can then be collected using a collector (for e.g. Prometheus) and the data can then be imported into any visualization tool (for e.g., Grafana) to be further analyzed. Refer to this [Guide](./metrics/README.md) to easily setup a dockerized Grafana dashboard to visualize the metrics.
